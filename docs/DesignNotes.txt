Minimum Viable Product (12-Hour Implementation):

Rough guidlines to follow to allow for rapid deployment timeline.
This is being done with a very aggresive timeline, so much of this will be refactored on the fly to achieve the results of producing viable code quickly. Primary goal is that it works, it's relevant and can be done in 12 hours.

Functionality to Implement:

Parse a simplified FIX log file (focus only on NewOrderSingle and Execution messages)
Extract security identifiers (Symbol/55 and CUSIP/48)
Compare against a CSV security master file
Identify mismatches where CUSIP matches but symbol differs
Calculate financial exposure (price * quantity) for each security
Generate a CSV report with discrepancies and financial exposure metrics
Data Sources
Use sample FIX messages in text format (one message per line)
Use a simple CSV for the security master with columns: Symbol, CUSIP, Description
Implementation Guidelines

Simplify the FIX Parser:


Don't build a full FIX parser - just use regex to extract relevant tags
Focus on Symbol (tag 55), SecurityID (tag 48), Quantity (tag 38), and Price (tag 44)
Limit the Scope:


Process only a small set of test messages (100-500 messages)
Handle multiple regions and exchanges but focus on equities
Include basic financial exposure calculations to show business impact

Omit These Features for now:


Real-time processing
Complex error handling
Performance optimization
Authentication/security features
Compliance reporting
Data visualization
Implementation Structure
Your implementation should include these key components:
Security Master Loader


Load and index the security master file by multiple identifiers
Handle different asset classes and regions
FIX Message Parser


Extract key fields including Symbol, CUSIP/SEDOL, Price, Quantity
Handle both NewOrderSingle and ExecutionReport messages
Discrepancy Analysis


Find symbol mismatches based on security identifiers:

Group issues by region and exchange
Calculate financial exposure for each discrepancy
Report Generation


Create detailed CSV with all discrepancies:

Include summary statistics with total financial impact
Sort by financial exposure to highlight critical issues
