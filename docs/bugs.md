# Critical Memory Management Issues

Chucking has been improved significantly, but I think it could be optimized much better. 
Memory management however has serious issues and needs more refacturing.

## High-Severity Issues

1. **Complete In-Memory Dictionary Creation**
   - `security_dict = {}` accumulates ALL securities regardless of chunked processing
   - No limit on dictionary size growth

2. **Full CUSIP List Generation**
   - `cusips = list(self.cusip_index.keys())` loads all CUSIPs into memory at once
   - Defeats the purpose of chunked file reading

3. **No Streaming Processing**
   - Analysis processes all FIX messages against entire security master
   - Should process in batches with controlled memory footprint

4. **Inefficient Garbage Collection**
   - GC triggers only after processing fixed count of records
   - No adaptive memory monitoring to trigger collection when needed

5. **No Memory Pressure Handling**
   - No mechanism to scale back processing when memory usage approaches limits
   - Missing fallback strategies for low-memory situations

## Potential Solutions

1. Implement true streaming reconciliation that processes FIX messages against security master in controlled batches
2. Add memory pressure monitoring with adaptive behavior
3. Use generator pattern instead of building complete collections
4. Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed securities
5. Add proper resource limits and fallback mechanisms
