# **Phased Performance Improvement Plan**  

**Project Context:**  
This is a **demonstration project** designed to optimize large file processing (up to **200GB**) while incorporating **production best practices**. The focus is on **efficiency, resource management, and proactive monitoring** to ensure smooth execution without overwhelming system resources.

---

## **Phase 1: Quick Wins (Baseline Improvements)**  
*Simple optimizations to reduce processing overhead and lay the foundation for performance scaling.*  

1. **security_master.py** – Optimize `get_security_dict()` to extract only **Symbol and CUSIP**, reducing memory footprint.  
2. **fix_parser.py** – Modify parser to extract only **required fields** and switch to `float32` for better efficiency.  
3. **config.py** – Introduce **configurable resource limits and thresholds** for tuning system behavior.  
4. **alert_system.py** – Implement **basic file size checks** and add placeholders for alerting.  
5. **main.py** – Integrate **pre-processing file size validation** and add a basic **execution delay** to avoid immediate overload.  

✅ **Impact:** Reduces unnecessary processing and establishes a baseline for monitoring.

## **Phase 2: Smarter Processing (Optimizing Throughput)**  
*Enhancing batch processing, dynamic tuning, and initial monitoring integration.*  

1. **analyzer.py** – Modify processing logic to work in **smaller, controlled batches** for better memory and CPU efficiency.  
2. **security_master.py** – Implement **dynamic chunk sizing** to adapt to system constraints.  
3. **main.py** – Enhance **cleanup mechanisms** and integrate **real-time monitoring**.  
4. **resource_monitor.py** – Introduce **basic CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking**.  
5. **alert_system.py** – Improve alerting with **tiered notifications** (warnings vs. critical alerts).  

✅ **Impact:** More efficient processing that prevents overwhelming system resources.  

---

## **Phase 3: Full Protection (Fail-Safes & Proactive Measures)**  
*Building safeguards to handle edge cases and protect production environments.*  

1. **resource_monitor.py** – Implement **progressive backoff** to slow down processing dynamically under high load.  
2. **security_master.py** – Add **CPU throttling** to prevent excessive resource consumption.  
3. **alert_system.py** – Implement a **delayed execution system** for scheduling and controlled execution.  
4. **resource_monitor.py** – Finalize **fail-safe exit mechanisms** to prevent unresponsive states.  
5. **main.py** – Fully integrate **monitoring, throttling, and alerting** to make the system **resilient and self-regulating**.  

✅ **Impact:** Ensures smooth execution without production downtime, making failures predictable and recoverable.

## **Estimated Time: 6-8 Hours (Including Testing)**  
This project demonstrates how to **efficiently process massive files**, while implementing **proactive monitoring and safeguards** to prevent system overload. The **alerting system** ensures that potential risks are flagged early, keeping operations stable.
